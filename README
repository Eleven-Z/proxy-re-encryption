==================================================================

This is a pre-release of the JHU-MIT Proxy Re-cryptography Library
(PRL).  A number of aspects of this release are incomplete.  Most
notably:

* The C API wrapper allowing C language programs to use the library
natively. Currently all linking applications must be C++ based.

* The User's Guide does not contain a description of the library API.
This will be remedied shortly.

Compiling the library: 
======================

Building and Installing the Library

The PRL is distributed in source-code form, and is targeted for Linux
platforms.  However, with small modifications the library should
compile on other Unix-type systems (provided that the MIRACL library
is supported), and on Windows platforms.  The Linux build process
outlined below assumes a system with gcc and other common utilities
installed.  To build the library:

1. Obtain the MIRACL library miracl3.zip from
http://www.shamus.ie/. Unzip and build the library archive file using
the following commands:

 mkdir miracl/
 unzip -j -aa -L miracl3.zip miracl/
 cd miracl/
 bash linux

These commands unzip the contents of miracl3.zip into the directory
miracl/--- ignoring the directory structure specified within the zip
file--- and build the library.  See the MIRACL documentation if this
step does not succeed.

Untar the file proxylib0_1.tar.gz in the same base directory in which
you created the miracl/ directory (this is important: the PRL build
scripts looks for the miracl/ directory here). Next, build the library
via the following commands:

 cd proxylib/src/
 make clean
 make

Run ./proxylib_test at the command line.  This utility runs diagnostic
tests on the library to ensure that it is correctly built and ready
for use.

===

By default, the PRL is built as a static library file (proxylib.a).
This library contains the proxy re-encryption routines, but does not
contain the MIRACL code required to actually use the library.  An
application using the PRL must link against both proxylib.a and
miracl.a (which can be found in the miracl/ directory).  Users who
find this inconvenient may wish to generate a single library file
containing all necessary code.  To do this, run the command ``make
withmiracl''.  This will generate a single combined library
proxylibmiracl.a that embeds the miracl object code.  If you choose
this option, you should not link miracl.a to your program, as the
linker will object to the duplicated code.
